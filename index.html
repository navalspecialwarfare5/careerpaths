                        <p>
                            The NEC 026A identifies a U.S. Navy enlisted service member who has successfully completed Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training and has formally entered the SEAL pipeline, but has not yet graduated from SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) or been awarded the NSW warfare designation (SEAL Trident).

                            This classification places the operator in a transitional training status—a critical, high-stakes phase in which the individual has passed the most physically and mentally demanding selection process in the U.S. military but has not yet proven operational capability in the full spectrum of Naval Special Warfare mission sets.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                Operators holding the 026A NEC are assigned to the Naval Special Warfare Center (NSWCEN) or other associated pipeline commands, where they receive intensive instruction in real-world SEAL mission preparation. 
                                Training under this NEC includes HALO/HAHO parachuting, combat diving, demolitions, trauma medicine (SOCM), tactical communication systems, urban breaching, foreign internal defense advising, and battlefield exploitation. Operators may also specialize in sniper, breacher, or SDV operations.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Upon successful completion of SQT, the operator is awarded the SEAL Trident (Naval Enlisted Warfare Device), reclassified to a follow-on NEC—typically O26B, indicating a fully qualified Special Warfare Operator and assigned to an operational SEAL Team under Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC). Until this point, 026As are under strict evaluation and can still be dropped from the pipeline for failure to meet physical, academic, or leadership standards.

                        <p>
                            O29A is the NEC for an operationally assigned and fully qualified SEAL within DEVGRU (Naval Special Warfare Development Group), formerly known publicly as SEAL Team 6. 
                            It is one of the most selective and classified NECs within the U.S. Navy, designating a SEAL who has passed internal assessment, selection, and specialized training within the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) 
                            architecture. Operators with this NEC are no longer standard NSW assets—they are Tier One Special Mission Unit personnel, trusted with missions of national strategic importance, including counterterrorism, hostage rescue, clandestine reconnaissance, covert direct action, and sensitive activities across the globe.

                                A D&E (Development & Evaluation) operator is a seasoned SEAL assigned to TACD&E or NSWDG, responsible for testing, validating, and refining new tactics, gear, weapons, and technologies under realistic conditions; they simulate real-world missions to assess operational viability, provide feedback to R&D and command staff, and often act as aggressors, instructors, or evaluators to shape future NSW capabilities.

        <p class="mb-4">
          DEVGRU is a Tier 1 National Mission Unit operating under JSOC authority, executing time-sensitive, covert operations against high-value targets. These missions are never arbitrary — they are born from weeks or even months of classified intelligence operations, multi-agency fusion, and joint strategic oversight. The process of mission creation is deliberate, exhaustive, and driven by actionable intelligence from both military and interagency sources.
        </p>
  
        <div class="career-block">
          <h4>Strategic Intelligence Pipeline</h4>
          <p>
            Operations begin with raw intelligence — gathered from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HUMINT: Field agents, CIA/SAC operatives, JSOC advisors</li>
            <li>SIGINT: NSA or JSOC Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)</li>
            <li>ISR: Overhead imagery and drone surveillance (MQ-9 Reaper, RQ-170, etc.)</li>
            <li>DOMEX: Captured documents, phones, hard drives, biometrics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This intelligence is analyzed at the JSOC J2 node or CIA Mission Center, validated by interagency liaisons, and elevated to Target Development Officers or PMOOs embedded in-theater. Once a pattern-of-life (POL), threat matrix, or confirmed objective is established, a <strong>target packet</strong> is built.

          <h4>Planning Cell & Operational Shaping</h4>
          <p>
            With a target identified, the Joint Planning Cell (JPC) — composed of NSW planners, SOAR liaisons, Air Force STS officers, and interagency reps — begins shaping the mission. This includes determining:
